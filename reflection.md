What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
It kind of exposes to me certain areas i didnt think would run to an error and uncovers those to me. It also requires carefullness because one thing could mess up the whole test. 
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- in order for JUnit to work, you original code shouldnt have any errors or shouldnt all of a suddent have a different names in JUNIT, classes such as you engine or train, car, etc. You would need to have the right methods you used to be corresponding with what your junit is testing for.
